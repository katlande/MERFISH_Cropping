# MERFISH Cropping
Full, high-resolution tissue images from MERFISH experiments can be many gb in size. Zooming in on specific areas of slides can be especially challenging, as Vizgen reports cell coordinates in ÂµM rather than pixels. Furthermore, the conversion between microns and pixels in MERFISH data is not always straightforward, as the micron coordinate system may be offset from the 0,0 mark of the pixel coordinate system. To simply analysis, this repo allows users to crop large images from the command line using the micron-based coordiante system.


## Setup
The cropping script runs in python3, and requires the following dependencies:
* numpy
* pandas
* pyvips
* Pillow

A minimal conda environment for this script can be setup with:
```
conda env create --name MERFISH_IMAGES --file=environment.yml
```

## Cropping images
Two input files are required for image cropping, both are found within the 'images' folder of the processed MERFISH data
* The source image, e.g., 'mosaic_DAPI_z3.tif'
* The micron to pixel transformation matrix, 'micron_to_mosaic_pixel_transform.csv'

A minimal run example:
```
python crop_image.py \
	-c micron_to_mosaic_pixel_transform.csv \
	-i mosaic_DAPI_z3.tif \
	-l 1500 \ # minimum x coordinate value in microns, "left"
	-r 3500 \ # maximum x coordinate value in microns, "right"
	-b 10000 \ # minimum y coordinate value in microns, "bottom"
	-t 12000 \ # maximum y coordinate value in microns, "top"
	-o CroppedImageTest # output file prefix
```

#### Optional Arguments

Image transformations, all are FALSE by default and should only be relevant if the image has been previously modified in some way:
* -f: Boolean, whether or not to swap the x and y axes
* -x: Boolean, whether or not to mirror-flip the coordinates of the x axis
* -y: Boolean, whether or not to mirrorflip the coordinates of the y axis

Output options:
* -j: file extension of the output. Automatically set to 'jpg,' but other image formats can be set. jpg maintains image resolution and it is recommended not to mess with this setting.
